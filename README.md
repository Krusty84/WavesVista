I just wanted to play around with SwiftUI, ChatGPT, and kill some time...


One of my hobbies is amateur radio, and I know that every radio amateur needs to monitor the state of the ionosphere and the sun to increase their chances of having a good and interesting QSO. 
That’s how this application came to be—nothing complicated; any radio amateur will understand what it’s about and how it works.

Thanks to the esteemed **[N0NBH](https://www.qrz.com/db/N0NBH)** for providing the service.
